## Reflection Stuff

I fixed my memory leak by changing my stuff to vectors and other
random shenanigans. Lots of stuff to change my shell since lab12.
I pretty much had to look up everything regarding pipes and what
not. I used a bit of Mike's example code for pipes and converting
vectors because it seemed better than reinventing the wheel.
